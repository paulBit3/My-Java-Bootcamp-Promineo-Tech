	/*
	 * In this problem you will create a multidimensional Array of int named arr.
       You are given two integer variables, a and b that are user inputs
       Use these integer values to initially declare your new Array arr, 
       where these integers determine the size of both dimensions of the Array
       Then, use these int values to create both an inner and outer Array using 
       some type of loop (maybe a for loop) that starts at zero and goes to whatever 
       number values are stored in a and b
       To complete this problem, when you've populated the Arrays 
       (after the nested loops have completed), print the last element of the
        first Array to the console.
       Here are a few tips:

       Error Checking: Make sure both numbers entered by the 
       user are greater than two (2). If not, print the following
       message to the console: "Both numbers need to be greater than 2."
       You will need to create two loops to populate the multidimensional
       Array, storing the index of the second loop in the Array positions.
